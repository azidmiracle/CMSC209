# INTRODUCTION

## Company Background

Craftsmanship is an inherent talent of local artist and entrepreneur Mr. Bengie Antido and his business partner Mr. John Michael Uy who started Kayamanan ni Juan Trading. Their creative minds are mirrored in each of the unique fashion accessories, novelty items, souvenirs, bags, and handicrafts that they design. Making use of indigenous materials, they put a touch of Filipino heritage and culture in their export-quality art pieces.

“Our creations are treasures showing Filipino artist’s craftsmanship - that’s why we called it ‘Kayamanan ni Juan’,” Antido said. On his designs, “We, in Kayamanan ni Juan, conceptualize and make our own signature designs,” he shared. 

Antido’s market has expanded not only to Mindanao but also in Visayas and Luzon. He also recently opened his own Pasalubong Center/Boutique at Columbus Plaza Hotel, Annex Building, South Osmeña St. cor. Champaca St., General Santos City. His products are displayed in KCC - General Santos City, Pasalubong Center at SM General Santos City, and Robinsons Supermarket GenSan. He plans to open distribution outlets in major malls nationwide soon.

With a starting capital of Php 1,000 back in 2013, Kayaman Ni Juan now has an asset size of around P800K with monthly income ranging from Php 60,000-Php 80, 00. Recognized for his contribution to communities, Antido was awarded with BPI Sinag Entrepreneur in 2016, clinching the Top 33 place. He was also awarded People’s Choice Award for the Wearables and Homestyle Category during the Treasures of Soccsksargen in 2016. He was also a finalist for “Emerging Entrepreneurs of the year” during the Yaman Ng GenSan trade fair in 2015, and “Injap Sia Young Entrepreneur Award” finalist given by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Helping Communities One Craft At A Time 

Antido built Kayamanan Ni Juan not as a self-serving business, but as a social enterprise, which provides income and livelihood to marginalized communities. Currently, he is providing skills training to as well as outsourcing some of his raw materials from Indigenous Peoples (IP) communities at Upper Labay, General Santos City; fishermen dependents of Calumpang, Gen. Santos City; female inmates of the BJMP - Gen. Santos City; and, an association of PWD in GenSan. “Some are also outsourced to Cebu and Bohol,” Antido shared. Giving back to the community, he conducts feeding for less fortunate children. “Part of our mission and advocacy is to help underprivileged communities even in our own little way,” said Antido.


## Definition of MIS

Management Information System (MIS) is an information system that serves as the backbone of an organization’s operations. MIS is used to record, store, and process data, and makes it accessible to improve decision-making and visualization of information.

Computer-based information systems have progressed as better technology became economically available, from electronic data processing to recent advancements in artificial intelligence that aids in decision making.

As the team has determined and will show in subsequent sections of the document, Kayamanan Ni Juan will benefit from a computer-based Management Information System, specifically one that is accessible online, so that the decision makers of the organization can make business decisions on the go, such as identifying which products are no longer available or even a step before that - knowing which products would need to be replenished before they run out of stock. Lead time to request for products is particularly crucial for Kayamanan Ni Juan’s business model of purchasing hand-made products from their identified communities.

The team deems the MIS implementation to be feasible for Kayamanan Ni Juan as it requires no additional hardware or personnel to operate and the operational costs associated with maintaining the system would be minimal.

The details of the project are discussed in detail in the next sections.
